# Security Fixes - User Subscription Isolation

## Problem Fixed
Previously, any logged-in user could see ALL subscriptions in the system, regardless of ownership. This was a critical security vulnerability.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated `/api/subscriptions/route.ts`**
- **Before**: Fetched ALL subscriptions from Stripe without filtering
- **After**: 
  - Finds the Stripe customer associated with the authenticated Clerk user
  - Only returns subscriptions belonging to that customer
  - Returns empty array if no customer exists for the user

### 2. **Updated `/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts`**
- **Before**: No authentication, no customer linking
- **After**:
  - Requires authentication
  - Creates or finds Stripe customer for the authenticated user
  - Links the checkout session to the user's customer
  - Adds Clerk user ID to session metadata

### 3. **Updated `/api/cancel-subscription/route.ts`**
- **Before**: No authentication, anyone could cancel any subscription
- **After**:
  - Requires authentication
  - Verifies subscription ownership before allowing cancellation
  - Returns 403 error if user tries to cancel someone else's subscription

### 4. **Updated `/api/update-subscription-metadata/route.ts`**
- **Before**: No ownership verification
- **After**:
  - Verifies subscription ownership before allowing updates
  - Returns 403 error if user tries to update someone else's subscription

### 5. **Updated `/api/validate-coupon/route.ts`**
- **Before**: No authentication required
- **After**: Requires authentication to validate coupons

### 6. **Created `/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`**
- New webhook handler for Stripe events
- Handles subscription lifecycle events
- Ensures proper linking between users and subscriptions

### 7. **Updated `middleware.ts`**
- Excludes webhook routes from authentication (since Stripe calls them directly)

## How It Works Now

1. **User Authentication**: All API endpoints require valid Clerk authentication
2. **Customer Linking**: Each Clerk user is linked to a Stripe customer via metadata
3. **Subscription Filtering**: Subscriptions are filtered by customer ID
4. **Ownership Verification**: All subscription operations verify ownership before proceeding

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure you have these environment variables set:

```env
# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Create two different user accounts**
2. **Each user creates their own subscription**
3. **Verify that each user only sees their own subscriptions in the dashboard**
4. **Verify that users cannot cancel or modify other users' subscriptions**

## Security Benefits

- ✅ **Data Isolation**: Users can only see their own subscriptions
- ✅ **Authentication Required**: All sensitive operations require login
- ✅ **Ownership Verification**: Users cannot modify others' subscriptions
- ✅ **Proper Customer Linking**: Clear relationship between users and their Stripe customers
- ✅ **Webhook Security**: Proper signature verification for Stripe webhooks

## Migration Notes

For existing subscriptions that were created before this fix:
- They may not appear for users until the customer linking is established
- Consider creating a migration script to link existing subscriptions to customers
- New subscriptions will work correctly with the new system
